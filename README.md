#### GitJump

A tiny git command wrapper for view git commits.

commands:

- ```git next``` (```git n``` for short): jump to next commit
- ```git prev``` (```git p``` for short): jump to previous commit
- ```git first``` : jump to oldest commit
- ```git last``` : jump to most recent commit

Have fun!
